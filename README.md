# Software-Test-Automation-with-JUnit

•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my program is functional and secure by methodically developing unit tests to test each individual component with valid and invalid input test data. The invalid test data is beneficial for checking that my code is robust and effectively handles errors. Valid test data is used strategically to show that my code aligns with software requirements. I can also use variety of Black Box and White box techniques to improve the quality of my code.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by evaluating elicitation data to determine software requirements and then building the functionality that aligns with those requirements. I take the time to understand the needs of stakeholders and the best way to fulfill them with the resources available to me. I develop unit tests to establish confidence that my code encompasses user needs.

•	How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software systematically and user-focused so that software requirements are met. I employ caution and limit bias to avoid bottlenecks and improve efficiency. By using discipline to structure my approach I can continue to improve the quality of the work I produce and the rate at which I produce it.
